  ## Installation
  
  You will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. In the program itself you will need to add the inquirer package from npm. You can add Node.js by going to its website at https://nodejs.org/en/ and downloading the current version. You can add npm inquirer by going to its website aat https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer and follow the installation instructions. 
  
  
  ## Usage 
  
  Once you are ready to complete the README for your project, start the program by opening a new terminal from the index.js file. Then the following command: node index.js, in the command line. This will start a series of questions that when answered will auto fill your README once the questions have been answered. Extra items, such as screen shots, video links and sections, can be added or removed manually.
